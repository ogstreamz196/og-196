            This page is maintained by the OG Studio team to answer common security and privacy
            questions about OG Studio. It describes the app-visible controls we enable today and is

              You sign in with Google or Apple via secure OAuth — OG Studio never sees or stores
              your provider password. Your session is held in your browser and can be ended at any
              time by signing out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Privileged actions (admin tools, role grants, coin balance changes) are gated server
              side by role checks, not by anything stored in your browser.

          <Section icon={Lock} title="Data protection">
            <p>
              Songs, lyrics, preferences and coin balances are stored per-user behind row-level
              security so one account cannot read another account's records. Internal bot
              configuration and admin tooling are restricted to signed-in users and admin roles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Transport is encrypted with HTTPS/TLS end-to-end between your device, our app, and
              our backend.

            <p>
              We collect the minimum needed to run the app: your email and display name from the
              identity provider you choose, the prompts and songs you create, your in-app
              preferences, and a coin/transaction ledger to power generations and referrals. We do
              not sell personal data.

              OG Studio uses a small set of trusted providers to operate: a managed Postgres
              backend with auth and storage, an AI gateway for lyrics and persona responses, a
              music-generation API for audio, and optional payment and analytics partners. Each
              provider only receives the data needed to perform its specific task.
