            OG Coins are a limited, non-transferable licence to use features inside OG BOT. They

            OG VIP is an auto-renewing subscription. Payment is charged to your Apple ID or Google
            Play account at confirmation of purchase. It renews automatically at the same price
            unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period, and your
            account is charged for renewal within 24 hours of the period ending.
