              <strong className="text-foreground">Account data:</strong> when you sign in, we
              receive your email address and a unique account identifier needed to keep your account
              linked and synchronised. We never see or store your provider password.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-foreground">Content you create:</strong> prompts, song titles,
              descriptions, lyrics, generated audio tracks, and your style, language, and

              balance and transaction ledger records generations, unlocks, referral rewards, and
              purchases. Card payments are processed by Stripe; we receive your email, purchase
              amount, and payment status — never your full card number.

              timestamps and a random first-party device token used only to limit free-account
              abuse. We do not collect precise location, IP-based location, contacts, advertising
              IDs, full device fingerprints, browsing history, or page-by-page activity.

            <p>
              We use your data to operate the app: generating lyrics and audio, storing your
              library, maintaining balances and purchases, providing support, and preventing abuse
              (such as free-credit farming).
            </p>
            <p>
              We share data only with providers needed to run the service, each receiving only what

            <p>
              We keep your songs, ledger, and account data while your account is active. You can

          <Section icon={ShieldCheck} title="5. Security &amp; your controls">
            <p>
              Data is protected in transit with HTTPS/TLS and at rest behind row-level security so
              one account cannot read another&apos;s records. Privileged actions are gated by
              server-side role checks, never by anything stored in your browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your controls: sign out at any time, keep tracks private or publish them to the global
              player (your choice per track), connect or disconnect Telegram, and adjust
              explicit-content and foul-language settings in the creation wizard. You are
              responsible for keeping your sign-in provider account secure.

          <Section icon={Database} title="6. Children &amp; content ratings">
            <p>
              OG BOT is not directed at children under 13. The app supports a parental-guidance
              (&quot;PG&quot;) mode that produces clean lyrics, and an 18+ mode for explicit content
              that is restricted by in-app settings. Accounts used by children should remain in PG
              mode.

          <Section icon={Cookie} title="7. Cookies &amp; local storage">
            <p>
              We use first-party browser storage to keep you signed in, remember preferences (such
              as bot mode and playback state), and keep a random app token for free-account limits.
              No third-party advertising cookies are used.

          <Section icon={Mail} title="8. Changes to this policy">
            <p>
              We may update this policy as the app evolves. Material changes will be announced in
              the app or on this page with a new &quot;last updated&quot; date. Continued use after
              an update means you accept the revised policy.
